Short description:
Use of metabolomics data to investigate metabolic syndrome and all possible trait associated. This traits include blood pressure, trigliceryde concentration, HDL and LDL choloesterol concentration, glucose plasma concentration, etc. 

The idea is to link phenotypic traits to a set of metabolites using metabolic features of NMR data coming from urine and serum sample. On the other hand we aim to link metabolomics to genotype. We will, in this case make an indirect link between phenotype and genotype, using metabolomics as an intermediate phenotype.
